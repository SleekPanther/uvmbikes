                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>We are a student club providing bike repairs and promoting bicycle use at University of Vermont. Stop by to get your bike fixed.</p>
                    <h2>Free Labor</h2>
                    <p>That's right, we're not here to make money, we're here to help you. Labor is free for UVM students & staff. If you're not affiliated with UVM, unfortunately we can't help you due to liability issues. We aim to reuse parts or provide cheap ones when the need arises.</p>
                    <p>Check our <a href="<?php echo $upFolderPlaceholder; ?>prices-services/index.php">Prices / Services</a> price list for common repairs. </p>
                    
                    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
                    <p><a href="<?php echo $upFolderPlaceholder; ?>contact/index.php">Contact us</a> to join the club. Sign up become a volunteer at the shop. Share you bike knowledge or learn brand new skills if you've never worked on bikes.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Bike Share and Rentals</h2>
                    <p>We provide access to wheels on campus to those that need them. <a href="<?php echo $upFolderPlaceholder; ?>prices-services/index.php">Learn more</a></p>
                    
                    <h2>Spread The Word</h2>
                    <p>We are funded through <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/sga/" target="_blank">The Student Government Association</a>. We need to show that we're an active club, so tell your friends that we exist.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Not Just a Boys Club</h2>
                    <p>We aim to be inclusive and aim to encourage women to learn bike skills too. We've offered women-only workshops in the past and plan to continue the series in the future. More on <a href="<?php echo $upFolderPlaceholder; ?>classes-events/index.php">Classes / Events</a></p>
