                        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                        <p>We’re a student led group at UVM dedicated to spreading the good word of bicycles.</p>
                        <p>Many of our members are also on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UVM-Cycling-Team-283115763304/">UVM Cycling Team</a>.</p>

                        <h2>What We Do</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Administering a campus-wide bike share available free to all UVM students, staff and faculty, so that all can experience the educational values innate to sharing bicycles.</li>
                            <li>We also run a Bike Co-op located at the bottom of the north stairwell in the Hills Building, which is meant to cater to all students by way of providing the area/tools to repair their own bikes, as well as the knowledge necessary to do so.</li>
                            <li>Both of these projects are meant to serve the greater goal of forming a community among bicycle users at the University of Vermont, the greater-Burlington area and beyond.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>In 2010, "Bike Users Group" was founded with a with a mission to provide free bikes for everyone at UVM as well as bike education.</p>
                    <p>In 2006, UVM student Ben Sarle launches Yellow Bike Project with 30 free yellow bikes in the same fashion. With no way of tracking the bicycles he released, the bikes were soon gone or broken down.</p>
                    <p>The Bike Users Group noticed the excess of unused, dilapidated bikes on campus.</p>
                    <p>Members were spurred on by the success of similar program at other universities and went forward with a new system.</p>
                    <p>The new program was more accountable. Bikes were linked to the student’s CatCard and fines if the bike went missing. It started with 3 hubs and 17 bikes and has grown extensively.</p>
                    <p>Bikes were maintained by members of the club, which has evolved into the bike shop we have today.</p>
                    <p>We have since updated our name to "UVM Bikes" but retain our mission and values.</p>
