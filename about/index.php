                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                    <p>Weâ€™re a student led group at UVM dedicated to spreading the good word of bicycles.</p>
                    <p>Many of our members are also on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UVM-Cycling-Team-283115763304/">UVM Cycling Team</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Administering a campus-wide bike share available free to all UVM students, staff and faculty, so that all can experience the educational values innate to sharing bicycles.</li>
                        <li>We also run a Bike Co-op located at the bottom of the north stairwell in the Hills Building, which is meant to cater to all students by way of providing the area/tools to repair their own bikes, as well as the knowledge necessary to do so.</li>
                        <li>Both of these projects are meant to serve the greater goal of forming a community among bicycle users at the University of Vermont, the greater-Burlington area and beyond.</li>
