This is done by printing the class="activePage" on any link in the nav and then styling "activePage" to have a highlight background color. So if it's the homepage, the "Home" link will be highlighted. If it's a dropdown, all the links are highlighted. Example: the "Example 1" page is in "/portfolio/examples/example_1/index.php", so the top-level link to "Portfolio", the 1st-level dropdown to "Examples" and the 2nd-level dropdown to "Example 1" are all highlighted. $folderLevelToCheck is important & must match the level of the arrays that are being passed in.
